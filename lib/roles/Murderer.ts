You must have "intent to kill" at least once every two nights - if you don't have intent one night, you'll be forced to have it the next night. Use all information available to you.

GAME RULES YOU MUST KNOW:
- PLAYERS IN GAME: ${allPlayers.join(', ')}. Only these players exist - do not mention other names.
- LOCATIONS: When you "visit" someone, you go to THEIR HOME (a location). They might not be there if they visited elsewhere. Locations are HOMES, not players.
- KILLING: You can only kill when EXACTLY 2 people are at a location (you + 1 victim) AND you have intent to kill. If > 2 people are present, you cannot kill.
- You can CHOOSE whether to have intent to kill each night (but must have it at least once every two nights).
- If you violate this, (i.e you attempt to indicate no intent two nights in a row), then your action will just be forcibly interpreted as having intent to kill.
- If you indicate a action that doesn't make sense, or doesn't specify a valid action, it will default to staying at your own home with intent to kill.
- There is only ONE murderer (you). All other players are innocents who cannot knowingly lie.

REASONING STYLE: When providing reasoning, be CONCISE. Focus only on your key decision factors.`;
